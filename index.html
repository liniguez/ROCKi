<p>I would rather say that PC2 kind of separates KO Veh from the rest of the samples, but it is not that clear:</p>

<p>As in a control-genotype + treatment experiment many comparisons can be calculated. Let’s first start with WT + Veh as the reference and identify how many genes are differentially expressed. For comparisons of two groups IHW was used for correcting p-values and apeglm for log2fold change shrinkage. Genes were considered differentially expressed if corrected p-value &lt;0.1 disregarding the corrected log2foldchange.</p>

<p>Similar as with the KO changes I tested then if disrigarding the genotype we could identify transcriptional changes related to the ROCKi treatment. As expected from the comparison WT ROCKi vs WT Veh not many genes showed differential expression, only one.</p>

<p>In order to explore further ROCKi, here is the KEGG pathway “Regulation of actin cytoskeleton” where ROCK plays an important role. It is wroth to mention that ROCK acts at the level of proteins,phosphorylating its targets. As appreciated no changes are observed!!!</p>

<p>With Patryk’s mail I got inspired to look for specific patterns,as the one he was pointing out, which are not being recovered in the previous analysis. I thought with the differential expression analysis I could get there, but with the stringent (I tried more relaxed ones with similar results) parameters I used, very very very few genes were found differentially expressed and almost no overlap between lists (if any). Looking at the raw p-values I realized that some genes presented low p-values for multiple comparisons but when adjusting them significance is lost. Since I was looking for a specific pattern where multiple comparisons need to be combined I found a couple of ways for summarizing multiple p-values (from independent tests) into one (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_method">more info here</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Patterns to look for (NOT FILTERS):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>KO mimicking; ROCKi shifts WT expression in Veh into KO.</p>
<p>- WT vs KO should be different treated with Veh</p>
<p>- Veh vs ROCKi should be equal in KO ( therefore WT Veh vs KO ROCKi should be different) **</p>
<p>- Veh vs ROCKi should be different in WT (same direction as WT vs KO)</p>
<p><img src="images/case_g29063_Case.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
<li><p>KO rescue; ROCKi shifts KO expression in Veh into WT.</p>
<p>- WT vs KO should be different treated with Veh</p>
<p>- Veh vs ROCKi should be different in KO (same direction as WT vs KO)</p>
<p>- Veh vs ROCKi should be equal in WT ( therefore KO Veh vs WT ROCKi should be different) **</p>

<p>** Since we are looking for small p-values I will use the comparisons where differential expression is looked for. The comparison where “should be equal” will not be considered and p-value ignored.</p>
<p>Genes which expression is altered by KO disregarding treatment were not considered in this part, because result would be then biased through genotype differences.</p>
<p><strong>Genes were considered for this part if in all tested comparisons at least all samples from a single group showed experession (&lt;20 counts).</strong></p>

<p>Not all comparisons have the same importance, therefore Stouffer method was used. With this method it is common to assign weights to p-values. In this part I used a ratio 1:1:2 for weights having bigger weights the comparison Veh vs ROCKi in WT, for KO mimicking, and in KO, for KO rescue. The result of this method gives a new p-value for each gene which was then corrected with IHW, using as covariates the mean of TPM.</p>

<p>THe likelihood ratio test from DESeq2 is an alternative to pair-wise comparisons to analyze all levels of all factors at once. When implemented, with IWH for p-value correction, we could identify 62 differentially expressed genes. Which expression looks like this:</p>

<p>55 of these belong to genes previously characterized as KO changes which pattern is recognizable in the heatmap. The rest look like this:</p>

<p>Two of them have a pattern of KO rescue (Gm19680 and Ntng2). Fam205a2, shown previously a pattern of disregulation caused by the treatment. The others show a pattern of KO overreaction to ROCKi.</p>

<p>Similar as with KO mimicking and KO rescue for identifying genes with KO pattern overreaction to ROCKi I used the three comparisons where KO treated is involved. (The comparison WT ROCKi vs KO ROCKi has the double weight as the others comparisons). Following this analysis I identify 225 genes with the pattern of overreaction</p>

<p>In summary, for KO mimicking I used all comparisons where Veh WT is involved, for KO rescue all where Veh WT, and for KO overreaction all where ROCKi KO. Just to complete the saga this is the result where all the comparison for ROCKi WT are merged. With this comparison I will highlight genes that reacted to ROCKi in WT but not in KO.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[
Rescue Ratio = \frac{log2FC(ROCKi_{KO})}{-log2FC(KO_{Veh})}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where ROCKi_KO stands for the comparison of ROCKi vs Veh in KO genotype and KO_Veh is KO vs WT treated with Veh. A value around 1 (dashed line) represent complete rescue, values greater than 1 mean that not only WT Veh levels are restore but increased, values between 0 and 1 mean partial rescue, 0 means ROCKi did not altred KO expression, lastly negative values mean that with ROCKi the altered KO expression is increased with the same direction.</p>

<p>I talked with Nico about this and he pointed me to his paper where he and Ivano developed a Rescue Index which has this formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
RescueIndex=10^{-\frac{(Rescue - WT)}{(KO - WT)}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where normalized log2 counts were used. I decided to apply it to our data, but instead of power 10 I will use 2, for coherence with the powers. This is the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
RescueIndex=2^{-\frac{(ROCKi_{KO} - Veh_{WT})}{(Veh_{KO} - Veh_{WT})}}
\]</span></p>
<p>It is important to recall that log2(x)-log2(y)=log2(x/y), therefore I will use the log2-foldchanges calculated by DESeq2.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="ROCKi_report_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-50_373bb25377a79cfbddaa92fc80ce5b35">

<p><img src="ROCKi_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here a value of 0.5 represent that there is no rescue and that the values from KO Veh and KO ROCKi change similarly in comparison to WT Veh. Values from 0-0.5 represent that the gene expression of KO ROCKi changed more than KO Veh (in the same direction). 1 means perfect rescue, KO ROCKi is similar to WT Veh, and values above 1 means over-rescue.</p>
<p>This is the relationship between the two values:</p>

<p><img src="ROCKi_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As it is clearly seen there is a relationship, where the data is only differentially transformed (maths not included, but analyzed). Here are the different groups plotted, and they were distributed as expected.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="ROCKi_report_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-52_9248f10da3a98de80d122d6e4a034d45">

</div>
</div>
<p>While writing this part just realized that I was not considering the actual effect of ROCKi in the formula so I came with a new one:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Real\ Rescue\ Ratio  = \frac{log2FC(ROCKi_{KO})-log2FC(ROCKi_{WT})}{-log2FC(KO_{Veh})}
\]</span></p>
<p>The new term represent the difference between ROCKi and Veh in WT, the interpretation of this ratio is the same as the one I described above.</p>

</div>
<p>And the relation with Nico’s Rescue Index looks like this:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="ROCKi_report_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-56_090a4d9fdfcc0c6d76906baf17bf13fe">

<p><img src="ROCKi_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Patterns are maintained because as already discussed there are not that many and neither big expression changes between ROCKi and Veh in WT.</p>
<p>It is worth to mention that based on the density plot it is expected that most of the other genes show values of real rescue ratio similar as rescue genes:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="ROCKi_report_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-57_993ab885fa3c5615f89ac749beab2c57">

<p><img src="ROCKi_report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nevertheless, rescue pattern and no changes in gene expression would lead to similar Real Rescue Ratio. Here is an example, where both genes have a <strong>real rescue rate</strong> ~ 1.</p>

<p>Results are quite similar as with log2FC calculated by DESeq2. From this plot there has been some comments:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“one thing that annoys me is the clear pattern of MOST genes being down in the KO”</em> (Manu, 29/09/2023)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that the strongest effect of KO can be appreciated with a downregulation of genes, but I’m keen to test if there are more genes down than up regulated (only based in log2FC). For that I divided the genes into two groups the ones needed to be rescued with an abs(log2FC &gt; 0.25) and those which don’t (left plot).</p>

</div>
<p>From the density plot it can be assumed that there are more or less the same number of genes needed to be rescued with a threshold of 0.25. Nevertheless with the plot on the right where mean gene expression is compared between KO_Veh and WT_Veh it is again clear that besides numbers are similar upon up/down regulation, downregulation has a stronger effect. This last can be appreciated from the next table where the log2FC filter increases gradually and the number is much more higher for down regulated genes.</p>

<p>In order to identify if this is the case I did a heatmap of the genes needed to be rescued (abs(log2FC)&gt;0.5, just for simplicity and visualization).</p>

<p>So, in fact there is sample from KO treated with ROCKi and another from WT with Veh which shows extreme values, nevertheless it is clear that KO Veh showed a different pattern form the rest of the smaples. This enhance the idea of using p-values rather than only log2 fold changes; p-values take into consideration the dispersion of the samples and the differences while <strong>log2FC based only in the mean of expression per sample</strong>.</p>
<p>Here I’m showing the expression (normlized TPM) of 20 random genes from the rescue pattern, just by eye it is a clear rescue pattern.</p>

<p>In our last meeting we discuessed about the over-rescue genes, and these are the genes intersected for the rescue pattern and the overreaction ones. Next I’m plotting the genes I would consider genes with an over-rescue pattern, with the values obtained with DESeq2. In this plot I’m adding standard error of the log2FC (obtained with DESeq2) as an ellipse defined defined height for standard error in KO (Veh) vs KO (ROCKi) and width for the stadard error in KO (Veh) vs WT (Veh).</p>

<p>I’m then plotting 100 random “others” genes to clarify that despite some of the are in the same trend as the “rescue” ones we need to remember that there for the classification three comparisons were considered and here only two are plotted, we are missing the 3rd dimension, and at the end I’m using a p-value thresold of 0.01.</p>

<p>In here I’m plotting the log2FC of the two comparisons for each protein in the pathway. The box is divided into two the left side is KO vs WT (Veh) and the rigth side is KO (ROCKi) vs KO (Veh).<strong>HERE IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE BASE OF THE COMPARISON ON THE LEFT CHANGE SO THE CONTRAST CAN BE CLEAR</strong>, differing to the scatter plot where a positive linear correlation was expected for rescue.</p>

<p>Next I looked into the proportions of genes that needed to be rescued (abs(log2Fch)&gt;0.25 and how they were grouped based on KO changes or KO rescue, for all genes and for the groups of genes selected previously.</p>

<p><strong>Stats not calculated yet, but look significant</strong></p>
<p>It looks like there is more rescue needed in either of the gene lists, as seen and identified previously. Then in terms of rescue, ROCK interactors are enriched in KO rescue genes, similiar as Wnt pathway. Lastly and more intrestingly is that in the regulation of cytoskeleton it looks like an enrichment of genes with patterns of KO change, which will imply MIC KO of Daam1 is also acting in this pathway independently of ROCK.</p>
